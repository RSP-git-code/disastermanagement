#  Disaster Risk Prediction Web App

This project is a **Django-based web application** that predicts and visualizes disaster risks for different countries.  
It uses past disaster data and a **Multinomial Logistic Regression model** to identify the probability and risk level of different disaster types. 
This project is developed as part of my **Engineering Clinics (Semester 5)** coursework.
## Features :
-  **Disaster risk prediction** using Multinomial Logistic Regression  
-  **Country-wise risk breakdown** with probabilities and Z-scores  
- **Risk categorization** into Safe, Low, Moderate, Danger, and Extreme Danger  
- **Interactive pie charts** using Plotly for disaster type distribution  
- **Explain Graph** button for easy interpretation of results  
-  **Dropdown with aliases** to avoid invalid user input (e.g., "US" ‚Üí "United States of America","Russian Federation ": Russia,"United Kingdom of Ireland and Britain":UK)  
-  **Tabular summary** of predicted disasters with frequency, probability, Z-score, and risk level  

## Project Structure:
This is important to implement the Django :

## Working of the website:

1. User selects a **country** from the dropdown (aliases supported).  
2. Data from `Disaster_Zones.csv` is retrieved for that country.  
3. The **Multinomial Logistic Regression model (`danger_zone_model.pkl`)** predicts disaster risk categories.  
4. A statistical **Z-score** is also computed to normalize disaster frequency.  
5. Each disaster is assigned a **Risk Level**:
   - Safe (‚â§ -0.5)
   - Low (‚â§ 0.5)
   - Moderate (‚â§ 1.0)
   - Danger (‚â§ 2.0)
   - Extreme Danger (> 2.0)
6. Results are displayed as:
    ## Country wise analysis
   - Prediction table (disaster type, probability, Z-score, risk level)  
   - Interactive pie chart of predicted disaster distribution  
   -  Explanation of the graph using gemini AI :

## üìä Example Prediction (India)

- **Predicted Frequent Disasters**: Floods, Earthquakes, Cyclones  
- **Probabilities**: Floods (72%), Earthquakes (18%), Cyclones (10%)  
- **Z-scores**: Floods (2.1 ‚Üí Extreme Danger), Earthquakes (0.7 ‚Üí Moderate), Cyclones (-0.3 ‚Üí Low)  
- **Risk Summary**: Floods are the highest-risk disaster for India.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it.  
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
3. Place the dataset file **`Disaster_Zones.csv`** in the project directory.  
4. Place the trained model file **`danger_zone_model.pkl`** in the same directory.  
5. Run database migrations with `python manage.py migrate`.  
6. Start the Django development server using `python manage.py runserver` in command prompt.  
7. Open the web application in your browser by the local link generated in the commandprompt.
